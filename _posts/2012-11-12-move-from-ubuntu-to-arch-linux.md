title: My move from Ubuntu to Arch Linux
---

About a month ago I decided to try a new linux distribution. I was using Ubuntu and was even waiting for Ubuntu 12.10. I chose [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) for testing, and Installed it on my netbook. I really liked the installation process! Then I chose [Xfce](http://xfce.org/) as Desktop Environment. After a few days I decided to move from Ubuntu to Arch Linux.

When I read an article about a window manager, I was reminded of Tiling Window Managers so I decided to check window managers before moving. After some reading and comparing, I chose [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) as my window manager.

So I installed Arch Linux with xmonad. I spent a few days on installing softwares and configuring. You can see the result in the below picture.

There is still a lot to learn about Arch Linux and xmonad, but I know enough to do the things I need to do.

If you want to try Arch Linux, the [Beginners' Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_Guide) is the best place to start.

[This guide](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive/John_Goerzen%27s_Configuration) is a good start on configuring xmonad. Other useful links:
